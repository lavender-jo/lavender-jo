                                Manal Abu Halaoua... A Jordanian Who Changed Her Life <br>
<br>
Through her work in the kitchen of Al-Karama, affiliated with the Jordan River Foundation in Jabal Al-Natheef, Amman, Manal Abu Halaoua was able to improve her family's income and contribute to positive change. Her earnings from the center enabled her to fulfill her daughter's dream of enrolling in a university. Additionally, she supports her husband in providing for the family's needs, overcoming life's challenges. <br>
<br>
Manal expresses satisfaction with her work in the kitchen, appreciating its proximity to her residence and the comfortable atmosphere of collaboration among the staff. She says, "We feel like one big family, which adds a human and social touch to our work dynamics, contributing to the development of our work processes. <br>
<br>
Abu Halaoua started making 'Ma'amoul,' traditional Eid pastries, a specialty of the kitchen. She emphasizes the traditional production method, giving the pastries a flavor reminiscent of the sweets made by mothers and grandmothers in Jabal Al-Natheef. Engaging in the work environment increased her responsibilities, prompting her to strive for a balance between her family, work, and teaching her children. However, all these challenges shaped her into a success story, living her life as an active bee, with organization as her motto.<br>
<br>
Abu Halaoua notes that one of the significant changes in her life is her shift from being reluctant to leave the house to becoming a socially engaged and productive individual who contributes to her family and community. Today, Manal Abu Halaoua is considered a role model for women in the region, respected for her ability to prove herself through her work in the Al-Karama kitchen. This opportunity allowed her to lead a dignified life for herself and her family.<br>
<br>
It is worth mentioning that Al-Karama is one of the development projects of the Jordan River Foundation in Jabal Al-Natheef. The center aims to empower communities and create economic opportunities for individuals. Around 210 women have been trained in cooking and food manufacturing, while approximately 290 women have been trained in embroidery, cutting, and sewing skills. <br>

                                <br>
Mrs. Tha'era Arabiyat from the city of Salt is a successful example of working women, as she is dedicated to the women's and youth sectors. Starting from a young age, she developed her hobby of embroidery, which helped her establish her project: embroidering traditional Saluti costumes and Jordanian scarves. This venture proved to be a successful source of income for her and her family.<br>
<br>
Arabiyat didn't stop there; she also provides training courses across the country for women interested in the field of embroidering traditional costumes and Jordanian scarves.<br>

                                In Pastry Making... Jordanian Woman Supports Her Family After Losing Her Husband <br>
                                <br>
                                Manar Alawneh lost her husband and found herself as a mother with all the responsibilities of a father. She struggled to provide for her small family and assist her extended family. Manar started making cakes and pastries, traveling between different provinces, before finally settling in the capital, Amman, with a dedicated place for her products. Despite the challenges of her work, which kept her away from her large family, she continued to stay connected with them and support them. Although she is the daughter of a former minister, this did not shield her from the hardships of life. She endured tough conditions, describing her life as a "dark period," but she resisted with determination and perseverance against the harsh days she faced.<br>
                                <br>
                                Mrs. Manar Alawneh, 46 years old, lived with her parents in the Taybeh area in Irbid, northern Jordan, alongside her four brothers and seven sisters. However, she soon left them for married life at the age of 14. She became a mother of three sons and two daughters within eight years of marriage and later became a grandmother to five grandchildren. After losing her husband, she found herself in the role of both mother and father, refusing to succumb to despair, supporting her small family, and not turning away from assisting her extended family. She embarked on a journey of struggle that ultimately led to success.<br>
                                <br>
                                Mrs. Manar proved that determination to confront challenges and set the right direction are crucial factors for individuals to achieve their goals.<br>

                                In the Jordanian city of Irbid, there was a 25-year-old girl named Amira. She was an ambitious and active girl who dreamed of opening her own business. She loved cooking and believed she had a talent for it. <br>
                                <br>
 One day, Amira's mother decided to open a production kitchen. Amira's mother was a strong and courageous woman who believed in her daughter's ability to achieve her dreams. Amira helped her mother prepare the kitchen and purchase the necessary equipment.<br>
 <br>
 In the beginning, the production kitchen was slow-moving. People were still reluctant to buy food from an unmarried woman. But Amira did not give up and continued to work hard.<br>
 <br>

                                Amira began promoting the production kitchen's products through social media. She also began catering at special events. People soon began to recognize the quality of the food Amira offered, and demand for her products began to increase.<br>
                                <br>
                                Amira and her mother faced some challenges due to social stigma. Some people looked down on their work, believing that they should not work outside the home. But Amira and her mother did not let that stop them from achieving their dreams.<br>
                                <br>
                                Today, Amira's production kitchen is one of the most popular kitchens in the city of Irbid. Amira offers a variety of delicious dishes that are in high demand. Amira and her mother are also a source of inspiration for women in the region, proving that women can achieve anything if they set their minds to it.

*Women's Empowerment in Jordan: Challenges and Prospects*<br>
<br>
Women are a pillar of Jordanian society, representing more than half of the population and playing a prominent role in all political, economic, social, and cultural spheres. However, Jordanian women still face many challenges that hinder their empowerment, such as:<br>
<br>
* *Traditional cultural norms that restrict women's role to the family.*<br>
* *Laws and regulations that do not uphold women's equal rights with men.*<br>
* *Discrimination in employment, education, and political participation.*<br>
<br>
Despite these challenges, Jordanian women have achieved many accomplishments, such as:<br>
<br>
* *Increased rates of education and economic participation for women.*<br>
* *Women's representation in parliament and government institutions.*<br>
* *Increased awareness of women's rights and issues.*<br>
<br>
*Challenges*<br>
<br>
Some of the most prominent challenges facing women's empowerment in Jordan include:<br>
<br>
* *Cultural stereotypes that restrict women's role to the family.*<br>
<br>
Many Jordanian families believe that the woman's primary role is to care for the family and that she should stay at home, away from work or participation in public life. These stereotypes prevent women from realizing their full potential and deprive them of opportunities available to men.<br>
<br>
* *Laws and regulations that do not uphold women's equal rights with men.*<br>
<br>
Some Jordanian laws and regulations still discriminate against women, such as the Family Law, which grants men the right to divorce without the wife's consent, and the Nationality Law, which grants Jordanian citizenship to children born to an Jordanian father only.<br>
<br>
* *Discrimination in employment, education, and political participation.*<br>
<br>
Women face discrimination in employment, where the female labor force participation rate is less than 20%. They also face discrimination in education, where the female university enrollment rate is lower than the male university enrollment rate. In addition, women face discrimination in political participation, where they hold only 10% of the seats in parliament.<br>
<br>
*Prospects*<br>
<br>
Despite the challenges they face, Jordanian women have made many achievements in recent years, some of the most prominent of which include:<br>
<br>
* *Increased rates of education and economic participation for women.*<br>
<br>
The female school enrollment rate has increased from 70% in 2000 to 90% in 2020, and the female labor force participation rate has increased from 15% in 2000 to 19% in 2020.<br>
<br>
* *Women's representation in parliament and government institutions.*<br>
<br>
Women hold 10% of the seats in parliament and occupy leadership positions in many government institutions, such as the Ministry of Social Development and the Ministry of Education.<br>
<br>
* *Increased awareness of women's rights and issues.*<br>
<br>
Awareness of women's rights and issues has increased in Jordanian society, thanks to the efforts of civil society organizations and government institutions.<br>
<br>
*Recommendations*<br>
<br>
To promote women's empowerment in Jordan, the following measures are recommended:<br>
<br>
* *Change cultural stereotypes that restrict women's role to the family.*<br>
<br>
This can be done through community awareness campaigns on the importance of women's role in society and the promotion of gender equality in education and upbringing.<br>
<br>
* *Amend laws and regulations that do not uphold women's equal rights with men.*<br>
<br>
Jordanian laws and regulations should be amended to ensure gender equality in all spheres, such as the Family Law and the Nationality Law.<br>
<br>
* *Remove discrimination in employment, education, and political participation.*<br>
<br>
Measures should be taken to remove discrimination against women in employment, education, and political participation, such as enabling women to obtain equal employment opportunities with men, increasing their university enrollment rate, and providing them with equal opportunities to participate in elections.<br>
<br>
*Conclusion*<br>
<br>
Women's empowerment is a complex and multifaceted issue that requires a multi-pronged approach. By taking the recommended measures, Jordan can make significant progress towards ensuring the full empowerment of women and achieving gender equality.<br>
